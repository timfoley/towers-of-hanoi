## Code Comments:

Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific note on code.

[https://github.com/timfoley/tower-of-hanoi/pull/10](https://github.com/timfoley/tower-of-hanoi/pull/10)

## Deployment:

> Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

**3: Excelling.** Deployed app works just like the local one!

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**3: Excelling.** This is one of the coolest first projects I've seen. The next step, like you already indicated in your code comments, would be to use a constructor function so that your reset functionality doesn't take too much space. Other than that, I don't see any quick ways to make your code DRY-er.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

**3: Excelling.** Your code was very readable thanks to comments and putting everything in an object.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**3: Excelling.** I LOVE this theme. Love it. Great UI. The animations are a very nice touch too.
